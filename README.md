# 🌌 Solar System (Minus the Sun) 🌍🪐

Welcome to the **Solar System Minus the Sun** – a galactic adventure where we skip the star of the show (pun intended) and focus on the planets and their cosmic dance around an *orb* instead! 🌟✨

## 🚀 What's This Project About?

Ever wondered what a solar system would look like without the big, fiery ball of gas that powers everything? Well, now you don't have to! In this simulation, we've ditched the Sun and placed a glowing orb at the center 🌐. Watch as planets orbit around it like tiny space travelers on a mission to nowhere… or maybe *everywhere*! 🌙

## 🎨 Features:
- **Cool Orb**: No Sun here! Instead, we’ve got a mysterious, glowing orb to light up the scene. Think of it as a space lantern – not too hot, but just the right amount of glow. 🔮
- **Orbiting Planets**: Mercury, Venus, and Earth – they’re all here, gracefully orbiting around the central orb like they’re in a cosmic ballet. 💫
- **Nebula Skybox**: This scene is set in the most beautiful nebula galaxy. 🌌 (Don't worry, it’s all digital, no actual space debris involved.)
- **Particle Effects**: Tiny particles floating around for that extra spacey feel. Think of them as little stars scattered across the infinite void. 🌟

## 🌍 How to Use It?

1. **Clone or Download** this repo.
2. Open `index.html` in your favorite browser.
3. Watch the planets orbit the glowing orb, while you (the space traveler) get lost in its beauty. ✨

## 🚧 Future Updates
- Maybe one day, we’ll add a Sun, but for now, it's just a mysterious orb, hanging out in the middle of space. ☀️ (Or maybe not!)
